INSTRUCTIONS:
Its breakout, a classic game.
A/D keys or LEFT/RIGHT arrow keys to move the paddle.
W or UP arrow key to start the game.
Sometimes the ball has a mind of its own so if it gets stuck press the R key to reset the ball.
ESC key to exit game and SPACE key to play the game again.

Special thanks to James for supporting us students in times of bleakness.
Thanks for the class and I hope to see you next semester!

##KNOWN BUGS##
-The hit detection for the ball is kind of finicky
-The ball is supposed to rotate but I never figured out why it doesn't rotate when I told it to
-The hit sfx for the blocks plays twice and I'm not sure why. It also happens whenever you hit space to replay the game.
